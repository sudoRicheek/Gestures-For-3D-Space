&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A **Summer of Code** project under **WnCC IITB** for designing both the front and back-end of a real-time gesture detection module. Everything related to the project including notes/implementations and related links to those will be hosted here.

  This is the link to the **detailed progress report** that will be maintained by me throughout the entire duration of this project, as a roadmap of requirements for this project and also, to keep a track of the resources and references that I'm using in this project. Most of the stuff that are not mentioned in this README can be found in the link above.

  This is a preliminary model of a Finger Count Recogniser, using the direct video feed of the webcam. This model has been kept simple,     with OpenCV as its only dependency, so as to study the comparative improvements in the future models which will be utilising **CNN**s and other Machine Learning techniques.

Zeiler and Rob Fergus from the Dept. of Computer Science, New York University, USA** which mainly explores the novel way of **Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks** through *DeConvNets*.
  
* [Dataset Creator For Hand Gestures](https://github.com/sudoRicheek/Dataset-Creator-For-Hand-Gestures)

  I wrote this *OpenCV* code to easily and quickly create my own hand-gesture image datasets for this project. It implements background subtraction and binary thresholding and saves both the original colour image with 3 channels and the processed single channel image.

  The above, repo hosts some of the notebooks and stuff that I had created while making the **CNN** Transfer Learning models for this project.

  This is the link to the heavily related **Summer Of Science** project that I've taken up alongside my **SoC** project. It will house all the notes and implementations that I'll create throughout the summer break of 2020 on this topic.
